##How to play

Every box contains a value, from 0 to 3.

Each time you discover a new number, your score gets multiplied by it (first one is multiplied by 1 of course).

If you discover 2 or 3, you get more points. 1, you get nothing more. And if you find a 0, the game is over.

You win the game when you discovered all 2 and 3 boxes. You can also stop the game to win your current score.

If you win the game by discovering all 2 and 3, you get to the next level. If you fail too many times, you can fall to lower levels.

Each level is more difficult than the previous, but you also get more points. There is a maximum of 7 levels.

Numbers at the end shows the sum of all numbers in the row/column (green value), and how much zeroes there are (red value).

Just click on a box to show it. If you want to mark the box like a draft, just keep the mouse on a box and press 0 to 3 on your keyboard.

If you clicked the wrong box, just keep the mouse button pressed and move your mouse away. Phew!

Refresh the page to start a new game (level 1 and total score 0).
